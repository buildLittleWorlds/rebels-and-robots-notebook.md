Yesterday was the assassination attempt on President Trump. This was [quoted in CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/melania-trump-statement-after-rally-shooting/index.html) this morning from a publicly-released letter from Melania Trump:

> A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald’s passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration.
> The core facets of my husband’s life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the
> best of times and the worst of times.

The word "monster" here is used as a contrasting word (?) to the language of machinery. But I'm not sure. The word "monster" refers to someone who "recognizes" something described as "inhuman." The "human side" of this thing recognized by the monster as an "inhuman political machine" is "buried below the political machine." Then at the end are words that have to do with the "human" - emotion, love, etc.  But the actual final language is a script that comes from two possible sources:

> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
>
> Charles Dickens, *A Tale of Two Cities*

and also perhaps an echo of marriage vows
> for better and for worse

Scripted language has more to do with machinery than spontaneous feeling, and this is a letter written as an expression of feeling but also a political document.
