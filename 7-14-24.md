Yesterday was the assassination attempt on President Trump. This was [quoted in CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/melania-trump-statement-after-rally-shooting/index.html) this morning:

> A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald’s passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband’s life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.
